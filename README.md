# aiming-proof-of-concept---pico8
A practice implementation I made for aiming projectiles at a moving target in PICO-8

â€‹I'm working on creating enemies that aim at the player and shoot in my current game project next so I put together this little proof of concept to make sure I understood how to do it.

The poc is interative. Arrow keys move the target and 'z' shoot a projectile at it.

You can find an interactive deployed version of this poc at this url:
